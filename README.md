# Nutrition-X React JS Application

This is a ReactJS application for logging your nutrition throughout the day. Using ReactJS as a component driven JS framework, foods can be added and removed easily by the user to keep track of their calories, carbs, fats, and protein intake. Future improvements include building out a backend support for the web app, so that   the user's can log in and save their nutrition information. In addition, adding in USDA API support to search for foods that have nutrition info ready to submit to the food diary.
